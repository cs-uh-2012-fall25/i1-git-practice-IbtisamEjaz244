# Paragraph:
What stands out is that the article highlights how software engineering is not just about writing code but also about applying structured approaches, similar to civil or mechanical engineering, to ensure software is dependable and maintainable. That comparison makes it easier to see why software engineering is considered a true engineering discipline rather than just “coding.”
